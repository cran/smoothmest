Description: Some M-estimators for 1-dimensional location (Bisquare,
             ML for the Cauchy distribution, and the estimators from 
             application of the smoothing principle introduced in Hampel, 
             Hennig and Ronchetti (2011) to the above, the Huber
             M-estimator, and the median, main function is smoothm),
